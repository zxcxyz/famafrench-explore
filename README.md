A way to visualize Fama-French portfolios historical returns


Data source - [Ken French's website] (https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html)

For plotting I use Bokeh, guide - https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/first_steps/installation.html


# TODO

- try out jupyter themes https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes
- fetch data from website
- add cumulative returns chart (to maybe estimate if now is a good time to use either strategy)
- add more charts and stuff
