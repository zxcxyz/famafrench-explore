A way to visualize Fama-French portfolios historical returns


Data source - [Ken French's website] (https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html)

For plotting I use Bokeh, guide - https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/first_steps/installation.html


# TODO

- try out jupyter themes https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes
- fetch data from website
- for cumulative return chart, use annual returns Ken provided (instead of incorrectly calculating them myself)
- for that ^, parse CSV into two parts - one with monthly returns, one with annual. Maybe use annual in all my charts??
- add more charts and stuff(be creative)
